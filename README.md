# Student-Sorting-Algorithm
This project was created for my introductory C++ class.  The program utilizes a merge sorting algorithm to sort students.

The instructions are pretty clear in the interface but here are the instructions:

1) Choose a number 1 - 4.  It is recommended you pick 1, to add something first.
2) Indicate how many students you wish to add into the database.
3) Input the names/ids/gpas of the students you wish to add.
4) After these steps, you can either add more, sort, or print.

Functions:
Add - Add students to the database
Sort - Sort students based on ascending/descending order;  The sorting is sorted using gpas
When using the sort function, you will be prompted which order you want to sort in;
Enter either 0 or 1 for this part. 
Print - Displays all student infomation in the inputted database.
Quit - Terminates program (WARNING: REMOVES ALL PREVIOUS DATA SAVED INTO STUDENT DATABASE!)

Enjoy!
